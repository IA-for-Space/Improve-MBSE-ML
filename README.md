## Overview

This project improves Model-Based Systems Engineering employing Machine Learning techniques. We tested our technique using space telemetric data.

We have two main objectives:

- Correlation: Develop and compare five machine learning techniques to find correlations between features. We reused the Polaris tool to generate the relation graph. So, we can compare graphically the generated graph and we are able to choose the one whose results generate more correlation between the feature of the data.

    More specifically, we updated Polaris with new Python code that allows the user to work with 5 available regressors: XGBoosting, RandomForest, AdaBoost, ExtraTrees, and GradientBoosting. We also modified Polaris to work with other datasets. 

- Causality: Visualize, study, and accept or discard causal relationships in the dataset's features using the tool Causalnex.
  
    We created a new Python code that stores the graph with the causal relationships generated by Causalnex. The user can visualize it, get the causality information, and add or remove the causal relation to the final result. 


Directory structure:

- src
    - Datasets: contains the datasets we're working with and the tools to preprocess it.
    - Python: contains the Polaris code we've modificated.
        - Polaris: contains all the Polaris code with our modifications.
        - Polaris-own-code: contains only the Polaris files we've modificated.
    - Workspaces: 
        - Causalnex: contains all work made for Causalnex.
            - doc-guide: contains testing code got from the Causalnex guide, a space to learn how to use Causalnex.
            - original-code: original Causalnex source code.
            - project_mod: contains Causalnex new class and notebooks for testing it.
        - Polaris: contains work for testing Polaris
            - graphs: contains the graphs in .json made by Polaris.
            - project_mod: contains a notebook for testing Polaris new functions.
